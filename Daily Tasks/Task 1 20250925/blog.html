            <h2>HTML Semantic Tags</h2>
            <p>HTML Semantic Tags are HTML elements that clearly describe the meaning of the content they wrap to
                both the browser and the developer. They introduce meaning to the webpage, rather than just presentation.
                </p>
            <p>
                Before semantic tags, developers often used generic div (division) and span (inline span) elements 
                with class names to define parts of a page. While browsers could render this, the meaning was not 
                inherent in the tag itself.
            </p>                
            <p>Semantic tags solve this by giving specific names to common page sections, making the code much easier to read, 
                 understand, and maintain.</p>

            <h2>HTML Grouping</h2>
            <p>HTML Grouping Elements are used to structure and organize content on a web page, 
                making the code more readable, maintainable, and easier to style using CSS 
                or manipulate with JavaScript.</p>
            <p>
                Grouping is the practice of wrapping related elements (like headings, paragraphs, images, and lists) 
                within a single container tag.
            </p>                
            <p>HTML has two main categories of grouping elements: Generic and Semantic.</p>

            <h2>HTML Inline vs Block</h2>
            <p>HTML elements are fundamentally categorized as either Block-level or Inline-level, 
                which dictates how they are rendered on the page, how they occupy space, 
                and how CSS styling properties like width, height, and margins apply to them.</p>
            <p>
                The key difference lies in their flow and box model behavior.
